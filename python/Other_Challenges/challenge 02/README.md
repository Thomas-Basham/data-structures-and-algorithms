# Code Challenge 02

## Using only a whiteboard:

    Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

Today felt like it went a little smoother than the yesterday. I tried to come up with the most simple solution possible and use only what I know already about python. My approach was to break the list into chunks by using list comprehension. I'm not 100% the code will work but I think the idea is in the right place.
