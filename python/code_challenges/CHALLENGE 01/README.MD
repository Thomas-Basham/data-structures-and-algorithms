## Using only a whiteboard:

        Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

I started off making things way to complicated and tried a numerous of different methods but realized how dependant I was on javascript's built in methods. After giving it my all for 2 hours I did some research and really simplified my approach. In the end I used a decrementing four loop.
