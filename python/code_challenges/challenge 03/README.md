# Code Challenge 03

## Using only a whiteboard:

    Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
    NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.
        Check the Resources section for details

## Approach & Efficiency

I approached this using an iterative method with variables that change according to conditions in a while loop. I think this is the most efficient way out of all that I researched.
