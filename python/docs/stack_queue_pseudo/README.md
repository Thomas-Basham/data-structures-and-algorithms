# Challenge Summary

    Create a new class called pseudo queue.
        Do not use an existing Queue.
        Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
        Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
    Methods:
        enqueue
            Arguments: value
            Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
        dequeue
            Arguments: none
            Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.h

## Approach & Efficiency
When it's all said and done, these methods will have an efficiency of O(1)
