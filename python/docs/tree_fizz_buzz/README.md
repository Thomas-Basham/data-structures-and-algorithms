# Challenge Summary

    Write a function called fizz buzz tree
    Arguments: k-ary tree
    Return: new k-ary tree
    Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5  or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but  the values modified as follows:
    If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

I approached this as if I already had well tested add and breadth first traversal methods for a k-ary tree
The efficiency is O(n) since I'm adding values to an array
