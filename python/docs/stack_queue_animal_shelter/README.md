# Challenge Summary
    Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
    The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
    Implement the following methods:
        enqueue
            Arguments: animal
                animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
        dequeue
            Arguments: pref
                pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
            Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
                If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.
